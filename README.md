The filter processes incoming messages and responds with the current date, time, day of the week, or year, depending on the request. It supports both Russian and English.

Key Features:
âœ” Understands date-related queries (e.g., todayâ€™s date, yesterdayâ€™s date, tomorrowâ€™s date, etc.)
âœ” Responds with the current time in HH:MM:SS format
âœ” Provides the day of the week for today, yesterday, and future dates
âœ” Returns the current year
âœ” Logs all processed requests for debugging
âœ” Leaves the message unchanged if it's not related to date/time

If the message doesnâ€™t match any predefined queries, the filter does not modify the response and logs it instead. ðŸš€
